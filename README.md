# CS88 website repo

The CS88 tools want to create a website that is rooted at a domain. All the paths are absolute.  The data-8 repository websites are
http://data-8.github.io/cs88 so to avoid changing all the scripts, this organization gives us a place to root the site.

Current, *make all* on the master branch will copy all the files into a directory above the cs88 repo.  These files are used to update
the cs88-website.github.io repo.  inst.eecs redirects to here.
